<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Green Beans</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 lbs. fresh green beans</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>2 Chicken boillon cubes</li>
 
</ul>
<h4>Filling/h4>
<ul>
    <li>8 oz. mushrooms</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons flor</li>
    <li> 3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li> 40 ox. marinara suace</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>

<h4>Prep work</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375° F.</li>
    <li>Begin boiling water in a large soup pot or Dutch oven. Once a boil is reached, add the baking soda and bouillon.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine the chicken broth, half and half, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, parsley, mustard powder, salt, and pepper in a medium measuring cup with a spout. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Dice the mushrooms and cut the green beans in half or into thirds.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Boil the Green Beans </h4>
<ol>
    <li>Boil the green beans for 5 minutes. Set a timer to avoid overcooking, we don’t want them to be mushy. When they’re done, they’ll have softened but will still hold their shape nicely.</li>
    <li>Drain well and rinse with cold water to stop them from cooking further. Spread out on a clean dish towel to dry.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Make the Filling</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Use the same pot that you used to boil the green beans and melt 1 tbsp. butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, garlic, and a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining butter along with the flour and cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth mixture in small splashes, stirring continuously. (Adding it slowly ensures that the mixture is thick and that the roux doesn’t break.)</li>
    <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Bring it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Let it bubble gently for 4 minutes, or until desired consistency is obtained. Stir occasionally as it cooks.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat. It will thicken a little more upon standing.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Assemble and Bake</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Add the green beans and stir to combine. Stir in the Parmesan cheese along with half of the cheddar cheese and half of the crispy fried onions.li>
    <li>Transfer to a lightly greased baking dish. (I used a 9x13-inch, but any size that holds the casserole is fine!) Top with remaining cheddar cheese and fried onions.</li>
    <li>Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, or until the top is brown and bubbly. Serve!</li>
